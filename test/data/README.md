Unless otherwise noted, the `*.gz`files were generated by the `gzip` command
line tool and the `*.deflate` and `*.zlib` versions were then generated by
`script/extract-deflate-offsets.go`. Similarly, the `*.giflzw` files were
generated by `script/extract-giflzw.go` and the `*.palette` and `*.indexes`
files were generated by `script/extract-palette-indexes.go`. The `*.tokens`
files were generated by `script/print-json-token-debug-format.c`.

The `*.jpeg` files are usually the canonical versions of the test/data images,
and other versions (`*.bmp`, `*.gif`, `*.png` etc) were usually generated by
ImageMagick's `convert` command line tool. The `*.wbmp` versions were generated
by the `script/convert-png-to-wbmp.go` command line tool. The `*.webp` versions
were generated by the cwebp command line tool. The `*.no-ancillary.png` files
were generated by the `script/strip-png-ancillary-chunks.go` command line tool.
The `*.qoi` files were generated by the qoiconv command line tool. The `*.pkm`
files were generated by the ETCPACK command line tool, except the `*.etc1s.pkm`
files were generated by a [custom
etc1tool](https://github.com/nigeltao/etc1tool).

The `*.apng` files were generated by `gif2apng`. Those with finite animation
loop counts were manually patched to correct for a `gif2apng` bug.
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=592735 argues that GIF
and APNG/WEBP have different semantics but `gif2apng` does not cater for that.

The `artificial-*` directories hold artificially generated test data, often to
explicitly test corner cases of various file formats. The files there usually
come in families whose names have a common prefix, such as three files
`foo.bar`, `foo.bar.qux`, `foo.bar.commentary.txt` all prefixed by `foo.bar`.
The file whose name is that prefix is usually the canonical (typically
hand-crafted) file, and the other files are then derived from that. Outside of
the `artificial-*` directories, the other files in this directory are typically
real world examples of various file formats, or deriviations of them.

The non-ascii directory holds trivial UTF-8 (but not ASCII) text files.
